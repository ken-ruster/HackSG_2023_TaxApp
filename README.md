# Project Theme: Financial Inclusion

# Problem Statement

  When he was working as a call center assistant in IRAS, Ken Wei noticed that many of the calls came from self-employed persons who were unclear on the terms used in filing, as well as how to enter their accounts into the iras website. Specifically, there was much confusion on what constituted an allowable business expense and material cost in the calculation of their adjusted and gross profits respectively. 

  In addition, IRAS has provided certain features to simplify the lives of such taxpayers, but some of those initiatives have left taxpayers confused instead. For instance, certain vocations offer the choice to declare adjusted business expenses as a percentage of revenue, saving taxpayers the effort of calculating their actual expenditure. However, certain taxpayers were confused, thinking that it is a mandatory option.
  
  Therefore, by making this app, we hope to resolve the issues of self-employed taxpayers being confused on how to keep accounts of their individual income tax.

# About the app

  OYOTax is an accounting application designed towards assisting self-employed persons in keeping track of their expenditures, and generating a 2-line/4-line statement to be used when filing their income tax.

  At its base, this application is an accounting application, prompting users to enter their income and expenditure information into the fields provided. What sets it apart from other accounting apps is its auto-generation feature - Based on the list of jobs the user entered, as well as their types, the app automatically generates a list of revenues and expenditures whihc the user is likely to incur, that are relevant to the filing of their individual income tax. The lists are, by default, based on the information available on the IRAS website, making them relatively comprehensive and applicable to a wide range of jobs.

# Future Plans
  As it is, the app is incomplete, relying on users entering and calculating their incomes individually. We therefore plan on including a calendar-based financial tracker which will automatically pass data to the rest of the app to calculate taxation info. Further, to further assist users, we aim to integrate our application with IRAS such that the information gathered in our app can be synchronised with the IRAS database, automatically filling in the relevant fields in their Income Tax form.
